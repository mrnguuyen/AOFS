All-in-One Folder File System (AOFS)

To use the file system:
cd ~
sudo kldload fuse
cc hello.c -o hello `pkgconf fuse --cflags --libs`

Open one terminal
sudo
then kldload fuse
then ./hello newHelloFS -f
(May need to run this twice if the first attempt doesn't go into foreground mode)
(Second attempt always works)

Open another new terminal
sudo
cd newHelloFS
then do the 4 types of operations above(create, write, read, and remove files)

To use the Benchmark:
sudo
use mv to move the Benchmark into the newHelloFS
then do sh Benchmark.sh
